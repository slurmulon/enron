> :trollface: Modeling and analyzing the dynamics of corruption with Clojure

---

Based on the amazing computational society work of Hokky Situngkir

The goal is to better understand the dynamics of corruption by reducing it to a simplified mathematical form and then running simulations against it. This may give insight as to how society can help inhibit the occurance and/or severity of corrupt acts.
